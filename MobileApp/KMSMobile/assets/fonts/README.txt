Copy the following font files from your Frontend project to this folder:
- CabinetGrotesk-Regular.ttf
- CabinetGrotesk-Bold.ttf
- CabinetGrotesk-Black.ttf

You can add more weights if needed. Only .ttf files are needed for React Native.

After copying, the app will use Cabinet Grotesk for all main text and branding.
